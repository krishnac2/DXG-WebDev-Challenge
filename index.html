        <h3>
            What solution would you use for mapping? Why?
        </h3>
        <p class="answer">
            I would suggest using Mapbox Studio as a solution for mapping. Mapbox studio allows users to filter
            POIs by category. This is helpful because one user might be particularly interested in rocks present in the
            state forest while another user is interested in the animals present. Mapbox Studio also allows
            users to view the website without logging in, which is one of the client's requirements.

        <h3>
            How would we make this thing cross-platform?
        </h3>
        <p class="answer">
            I would utilize React Native because it is a cross-platform framework that facilitates building iOS and
            Android apps with one codebase. Building an app using React Native is much cheaper than developing separate iOS and Android apps.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>
            Any front-end frameworks you’d suggest we use? Why?
        </h3>
        <p class="answer">
            I would suggest using React as a front-end framework along with React Native for the mobile app
            because they have a similar syntax so the developers working on the mobile app can easily transition
            to front-end development. In addition, both are frameworks with high speed and performance.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>
            Any back-end technology you’d suggest we use? Why?
        </h3>
        <p class="answer">
            I would recommend using Firebase as a back-end technology to use alongside React Native and React.
            Firebase provides a range of tools for building mobile and web applications, including a real-time database,
            authentication, and storage.
            The client requires an app that can store and retrieve data and authenticate the various researchers with
            logins. Firebase has services for those requirements.
            In addition, during my interview, I learned that there are developers in DXG who already have experience
            with
            Firebase. This would allow them to work more quickly and efficiently, as they already understand the various
            tools and
            services offered by the platform.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>
            How do we handle the login stuff?
        </h3>
        <p class="answer">
            Login functionality can be implemented using a login form and the Firebase
            authentication SDK. This service is secure and reliable, and it saves time because it does not require the
            developers to create a custom authentication service.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>
            Where should we store the data on uploaded POIs and what does that data look like?
        </h3>
        <p class="answer">
            I would suggest using Cloud Firestore to store data on the uploaded POIs because it
            is part of Firebase. The platform can easily store and retrieve data for the app, which is the main purpose of the app. Since DXG has been using Cloud Firestore a lot, developers will be familiar with the
            platform, reducing the development time and allowing them to build a more integrated and efficient
            app. The data looks like 
            <ul>
                <li>The name of the POI</li>
                <l1>The image of the POI</li>
                <li>The category of the POI</li>
                <li>The description of the POI</li>
                <li>The exact location of the POI</li>
                <li>The date that the researcher saw the POI</li>
                <li>The username of the researcher who uploaded the POI</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <br>

        <h3>What happens if the researchers lose cell service in the middle of the state forest?</h3>
        <p class="answer">The app can utilize the Offline Data Sync feature in Cloud Firestore. This will sync
            data between the
            local device and the cloud database when a connection is restored allowing researchers to be able to
            use the app offline and the data would be synced with the database when their device has connection again.
